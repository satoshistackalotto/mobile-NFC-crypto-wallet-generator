# mobile-NFC-crypto-wallet-generator
An open source wallet that will generate wallets for the recipient, from the sender who has zero knowledge of private keys. 

Using already existing code, for ethereum wallet generation,  ( https://github.com/Omodaka9375/xEth-wallet-for-NFC?ref=hackernoon.com ). 
It should be possible to make an opensource application that works on the phone to generate wallets onto an NFC card without the senders knowledge of private keys, no details of the receiving NFC wallet should be stored in the phone.   
The essential utility of this application is that an ethereum/bitcoin/crypto user can send funds to a receiver who does not have a wallet address to receive funds thus introducing more people into the crypto ecosystem and allowing for fungibility in physical transfer of crypto.
